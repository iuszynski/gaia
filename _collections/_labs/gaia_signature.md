Design of machine learning and statistical models to uncover neural signatures psychiatric disorders. Our goal is to harness the power of data by overseeing the effective management of multiple large-scale national and European initiatives. This will allow us to train and refine AI models to their fullest potential.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) combined with neuroimaging opens up possibilities for personalized medicine. With this long-term objective, we developed four lines of research:

**MODELS TO PRODUCE INT​​​ERPRETABLE BRAIN SIGNATURES OF DISORDERS**

We investigated new predictive linear models that integrate prior biological knowledge to force the solution to adhere to biological priors, producing more plausible interpretable signatures. These models have been used to uncover an anatomical pattern of schizophrenia and a functional pattern for hallucinations. We embraced the applied mathematic challenge of creating scalable optimization solvers [for high-dimensional neuroimaging data while being flexible enough to integrate various priors.

**MODELS TO ​​BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN BIG AND SMALL DATA**

Thanks to the award of a Chair in AI (2020-2025), we proposed new weakly-supervised deep neural networks that are pre-trained on large datasets of controls, using auxiliary information such as “age” to improve the embedded representation of the general variability. Models are then transferred to smaller samples of patients to reveal the specific signal associated with psychiatric disorders.

**MODELS FOR PA​​​TIENTS’ STRATIFICATION ​​INTO HOMOGENEOUS SUBGROUPS**

With shared etiologies for individualized therapeutic strategy.

**UNLOCKING TH​​​E DATA ACCESS**

Learning models require collecting more and better data (wide and deep phenotyping). First, we tackled the “big data challenge” by aggregating open datasets (UKB, ABCD, HBN) into an interoperable database. Second, we actively contributed and will continue to play a major role to the emergence of deeply phenotyped datasets by leading the data management and analysis of several large European and national projects (PEPR PROPSY, RHUs FAME and PsyCARE, European project R-LiNK). ​
